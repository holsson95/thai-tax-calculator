## What is Tax Residency?

Tax residency determines which country has the right to tax your income. In Thailand, the rules are straightforward but important to understand.

## The 180-Day Rule

Thailand uses a simple test to determine tax residency: if you spend 180 days or more in Thailand during a calendar year, you are considered a Thai tax resident.

### Key Points:
- Days are counted per calendar year (January to December)
- Partial days typically count as full days
- The days don't need to be consecutive

## Tax Implications

**As a Thai Tax Resident:**
- You are taxed on income earned in Thailand
- You may be taxed on foreign-sourced income brought into Thailand
- You must file an annual tax return if your income exceeds the filing threshold

**As a Non-Resident:**
- You are only taxed on income earned within Thailand
- Different withholding rates may apply
- You may still need to file depending on your income type

## Planning Tips

1. Keep records of your travel in and out of Thailand
2. Understand the timing of your income remittances
3. Consider tax treaties between Thailand and your home country
4. Consult with a tax professional for complex situations

    excerpt: 'Understand how progressive tax rates work in Thailand and calculate your effective tax rate.',
    content: `
## Progressive Tax System

Thailand uses a progressive tax system where higher income is taxed at higher rates. Only the income within each bracket is taxed at that rate.

## 2024 Tax Brackets

| Taxable Income (THB) | Tax Rate |
|---------------------|----------|
| 0 - 150,000 | Exempt |
| 150,001 - 300,000 | 5% |
| 300,001 - 500,000 | 10% |
| 500,001 - 750,000 | 15% |
| 750,001 - 1,000,000 | 20% |
| 1,000,001 - 2,000,000 | 25% |
| 2,000,001 - 5,000,000 | 30% |
| Over 5,000,000 | 35% |

## How It Works

The first 150,000 THB of taxable income is always exempt. Then each subsequent bracket applies only to the income within that range.

### Example Calculation

For a taxable income of 600,000 THB:
- First 150,000: 0 THB (exempt)
- 150,001 - 300,000: 7,500 THB (150,000 × 5%)
- 300,001 - 500,000: 20,000 THB (200,000 × 10%)
- 500,001 - 600,000: 15,000 THB (100,000 × 15%)
- **Total Tax: 42,500 THB**
- **Effective Rate: 7.08%**

## Key Takeaways

1. Your marginal rate applies only to income in that bracket
2. The effective rate is always lower than your top bracket
3. Deductions reduce your taxable income before applying brackets
4. Use our calculator to see your exact breakdown
